initial checklist: 

-  Get the base game to work
-  Set a timer to let the user know how long it took them to finish
-  let users get another puzzle whenever they want

  In the future:
-  allow multiple players to play at the same time
-  add note functionality
-  add undo in addition to simple deletion
